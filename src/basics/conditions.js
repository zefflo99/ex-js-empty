/**
 * JavaScript is different from Rust or Java, the typing system is fully dynamic.
 * This mean 2 important things :
 * - You cannon precise variables types, function parameters types and return
 *   types, so there are no guaranties that the type you expect would be provided
 * - JavaScript engine will try to match types dynamically, so you can do things like
 *   comparing numbers and string, but internally JS always do type conversion, this
 *   can lead to unexpected behaviors
